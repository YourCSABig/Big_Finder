## satirical program made for CSA
Find your big - 100% potential satisfaction guaranteed!

**Added .exe for convenience - should run on windows! Just download the folder and click the .exe, and it should run**

You still might need python though.

Please install python 3.9 on your device: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/

If you already have python3 installed, perhaps you don't need to.
However - make sure that pip is installed as well **(no need if you're running the .exe!)**: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

In the same directory as the file (using cmd for windows, terminal for Mac, etc), run **python3 big_finder.py**
