Find your big - 100% potential satisfaction guaranteed!

You need python... Play the game, if you want the hint :)

Please install python 3.9 on your device: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/

If you already have python3 installed, perhaps you don't need to.
However - make sure that pip is installed as well **(no need if you're running the .exe!)**: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

In the same directory as the file (using cmd for windows, terminal for Mac, etc), run **python3 big_finder.py**
